    Parameters
    ----------
    x
        Array with data. Some of it's dimensions are spatial. We extract 
        spatial patch specified by spatial location and spatial size. If
        available patch is smaller than required, we pad with zeroes.
    center_idx
        Location of the center of the patch. Components
        correspond to spatial dimensions. If some of patch size components was
        even, patch center is supposed to be on the right center pixel.
    patch_size
        Spatial patch size. Output will have original shape for
        non-spatial dimensions and patch_size shape for spatial dimensions.
    spatial_dims
        Which of x's dimensions consider as spatial. Accepts
        negative parameters.
